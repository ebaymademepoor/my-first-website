# My first website!

Welcome to my first proper webpage after hours of tinkering with other technologies!

I've had a lot of fun with html and css so far and feel efficient in those.  

I've also played about with frameworks like Bootstrap and Semantic UI which are excellent!

Javascript is tricky but I'm sure I'll get the hang of it.  There are some great websites like paper.js and howler.js which allow you to add some very clever things.

I'm really enjoying using Git and Github to track and publish changes, very cleaver indeed!

I've also dabbled with MongoDB and a number of it's npms!  Everything so far has been really interesting and I can't wait to master all of it!
